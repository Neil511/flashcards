What is Cryptography?, securing communiations in the presence of malicious adversaries
What are the goals of Cryptography?, confidentiality data integrity data origin authentication non-repudiation
What is confidentiality?, keeping data secret from all but those authorized to see it
What is data integrity?, ensuring data has not been altered by unauthorized means
What is data origin authentication?, validating the source of data
What is non-repudiation?, preventing an entity from denying previous comments or actions
What does SSL stand for?, secure sockets layer
What does SSL do?, validate the authenticity of a website
What is the definition of a secure SKES?, it is semantically secure against chosen-plaintext attack by a computationally bound adversary
What are the goals of an adversary?, recover the secret key recover the plaintext learn some partial information about the plaintext
Why is OTP considered useless?, the key must be as long as the message and it cannot be reused
What does a Pseudorandom Bit Generator do?, it is a deterministic algorithm that takes a seed and generates a longer sequence called a keystream
What does the security level of of L mean?, that the fastest attack takes 2^L operations
What is diffusion in the context of block ciphers?, each ciphertext bit depends on all the plaintext bits
What is confusion in the context of block ciphers?, relationship between the ciphertext and the key is complicated
What properties do MAC schemes provide?, data integrity and data origin authentication
What does it mean for a MAC to be secure?, given a message and tag pair it is computationally infeasible to compute a message-tag pair
What is the drawback with symmetric key cryptography?, both parties must share a common key beforehand and keep track of everyone's keys
Why can non-repudiation never be accomplished with SKC?, both parties share a common key and the message could be from either party
What is input size?, it is the number of bits required to store the input using a reasonable encoding
